# GoodGrants CSV Bulk Uploader

This is a full-stack **Next.js** application designed to streamline the process of submitting large volumes of application data from a CSV file to the **GoodGrants API**.  
It provides a robust, user-friendly interface for managing the upload process, handling errors, and maintaining a complete history of all submissions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Client-Side Upload**:  
  A modern, responsive UI allows users to easily upload CSV files.

- **Server-Side Parsing**:  
  Leveraging **Next.js Server Actions** and the `csv-parser` library, the application performs robust data parsing on the server, efficiently handling large files and complex data formats (including commas within quoted strings).  
  It also automatically detects and ignores blank rows.

- **Dynamic Data Transformation**:  
  The application intelligently transforms CSV data to match the required API payload. Key transformations include:
  - Normalizing phone number formats (e.g., `0161...` ‚Üí `+880161...`).
  - Standardizing age ranges (e.g., `2635years` ‚Üí `26 - 35 years`).
  - Dynamically mapping challenge statement fields based on a user-confirmed municipality.

- **Batch Processing with Confirmation**:  
  To prevent timeouts and improve control, applications are divided into **batches of 20**. Users must confirm each batch before it is submitted to the API.

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**:  
  - Batches with **3 or fewer failed applications** are automatically saved to a dedicated database table.  
  - Batches with **more than 3 errors** require user confirmation before failed records are stored.

- **Persistent History**:  
  All processing data, including the original CSV file and processing logs, is stored in a **Neon PostgreSQL** database.

- **"Failed Submissions" Management**:  
  A dedicated tab allows users to:
  - View all failed applications.  
  - Export them to CSV for review.  
  - Mark failed records as resolved.
